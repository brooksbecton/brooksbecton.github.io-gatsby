I created a web site for visualizing the data found in the Star Wars API. Allows users to insert nodes into a graph and the app will generate the possible edges for the nodes

[Check It Out](https://brooksbecton.github.io/SWAPI-Graph/)

I had started making a few posts about how asynchronous code works in JavaScript. At the the end of these I wanted to make a challenge so that someone could get some practice with the new ideas they had just learned about. Also, I wanted to use the [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/) as a data source.

Why SWAPI?

1.  It's completely open, no keys required

2.  It's Star Wars.

## Origin

The ending challenge for one was to follow a chain of resources from the SWAPI to help users see what callback hell can look/feel like. Then I thought about how I could maybe show these relationships from the SWAPI. I immediately thought of a graph with nodes and edges. I could make the graph just for the information I asked them to give, but I wanted it to be more dynamic.

## Goals

My goals were to make a small intuitive app with a short life span. I stuck with React for this one and looked at a couple of different graphing libraries in JS. Most were fairly straight forward, but [vis](http://visjs.org/) was the easiest to get up and running with. I also wanted to UI to look slick. I have used [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) before so I wanted to try something new. After a little bit of searching, I came across [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) and it seemed pretty popular (20k\+ stars at the time of writing).\
\
I had a good time making this little app. I used the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) cli for the boiler and I didn't know that it registered a [service worker](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/) in production. Which helps out a lot. I cache the response from the SWAPI in the app to avoid a lot of back and forth and with the service worker registered that even further decreases the amount of information going over the wire. Also, almost anytime I can get a service worker easily integrated I like to try to max out the [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) scores in Chrome.

Here is what I ended up with at the time of writing.

* **PWA** - 100

* **Performance** - 76

* **Accessibility** - 94

* **Best Practices** - 94

## Challenges

### Graph

I made a small little "class" that helps interface the vis graphs with the data from the SWAPI. At first I dumped the
entire contents of the SWAPI into the graph.

<img class="lazy" data-src="/uploads/unknown.png" sizes="(min-width: 100%)"  />

There was way too much information on the page so I needed a way to filter down that information of to build up graphs. I went with the building up just so that users could make the graphs that they want and that would potentially use less data rather than pulling down all down and then having them filter down to a graph.

### First Meaningful Paint

Getting the the first meaningful paint in under 300ms was pretty tough and that is one of the main reasons the Performance in the lighthouse audit is a 76. If you are using an external library for CSS, it can be tough for it to not take up a lot of time block a paint. I did a few things such as using [React Loadable](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/react-loadable) to code split on routes.

<img class="lazy" alt="Screenshot of the console containing before and after sizes of bundles" data-src="/uploads/after&BeforeCodeSplit.png" sizes="(min-width: 100%)"  />

_After and Before Shot of Bundle Sizes_

It helped reduce the size of the blocking scripts, but I'm still thinking about this one.

## Wrap Up

I'm glad I made this. I got to try a few new technologies and ran into some challenges that I haven't run into before. So now what? Go check out the graph and open some issues if you find any bugs or have an idea for improvements.
